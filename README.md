Any stock you search up will also record the data for that stock in a csv file. This data can be found within this working directing in a folder called ```StockData```. This data will be avaliable for the user to perform more advanced technical analysis. 
## How to run

First let us install the following modules:
   - BeautifulSoup4
   - Requests
   - lmxl
   - HTMLParser
   - Matplotlib       
 
If you already have these modules installed in python, you can go onto the next step. 

If you do not have these modules, run ```download.py``` to install any / update necessary files (Only required once). 
  
Now, to finally run the StockTrader program, run the ```main.py``` file.

### Note:
 
In order to see the graph change frequently, you have to run the graph in market hours. This translates to 7:30 AM to 2 PM in Edmonton time.
